To Do
=====
- Finish implementing hound.py
- Write identifiers (zip, pdf, jpeg, etc.)
 - these can be split into multiple files
 - see my example java_class.py, this is how I'm thinking this will look
- Figure out how to load identifiers
- Document Project
 - project report
 - project presentation
 - project demonstration screencast
